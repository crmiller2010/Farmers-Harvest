## About Farmers-Harvest<br>
Farmers Harvest is a website where farmers are able to share the produce products that they are currently selling. Guests using Farmers Harvest are able to search through the farmerâ€™s posts and decide which produce they are wanting to buy and from what farmer. Farmers are able to make a Farmers Harvest account by creating a username and password for logging in. Once they have created an account, they are able to login and create a new product post for their profile. When creating a new product post, farmers will need to put in the product name, approximate quantity, price per quantity and a picture of the product. Farmers are able to add, edit and delete the posts as they please. When farmers sign into their account there will be a history section that displays all of the produce they have listed for sale.
